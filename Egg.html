        Instructions:
    </h2>
    <li>Marinate the Egg</li>
    <p>In a large bowl, mix the chicken pieces with yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, turmeric powder, red chili powder, garam masala, salt, and lemon juice. Allow it to marinate for at least 1-2 hours, or preferably overnight in the refrigerator.</p>
    <li>Cook the Rice:</li>
    <p>- Rinse the soaked basmati rice under cold water.</p>
    <p>- In a large pot, bring water to a boil. Add salt, bay leaves, cardamom pods, cloves, and cinnamon stick.</p>
    <p>- Add the rinsed rice and cook until it's 70-80% cooked. Drain the water and set aside.</p>
<li>Prepare Biryani Masala:</li>
<p>- In a large pan, heat ghee or oil over medium heat.</p>
<p>- Add cumin seeds and fennel seeds. Once they splutter, add sliced onions and sauté until golden brown.</p>
<p>- Add ginger-garlic paste and chopped green chilies. Sauté for a minute until the raw smell disappears.</p>
<p>- Add chopped tomatoes, turmeric powder, red chili powder, and biryani masala. Cook until the tomatoes are soft and the oil separates.</p>
<p>- Add marinated chicken and cook until it's partially cooked.</p>
<li>Layering and Dum Cooking:</li>
<p> - In a heavy-bottomed pan or biryani pot, layer half of the partially cooked rice.</p>
<p> - Sprinkle chopped mint leaves and cilantro over the rice layer.</p>
<p> - Add the remaining chicken masala over the rice layer.</p>
<p>- Top it with the rest of the partially cooked rice.</p>
<p>- Garnish with fried onions and a few mint leaves.</p>
<p>- Cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid or seal it with aluminum foil. Cook on low heat for about 20-25 minutes to allow the flavors to meld and the chicken to cook completely.</p>
<li>Serve:</li>
<p>- Once done, gently fluff the biryani with a fork.</p>
<p>- Serve hot with raita (yogurt side dish) or a simple cucumber and mint salad.</p>
